# google_doc_clone

Google Doc Clone Project for the iOS Android and Web

## Getting Started

Try to make a clone of google doc for all the possible cross platform.

This application will not cover the UI part only focused on the functionality.

The resoureces I used in the project are---
1. Google_sign in plugin for the authentication using google
2. Shared Preferences for the local storage
3. Flutter_riverpod for  the state management tool.
3. Socket_io_client.
4. Node.js for the backend.
5. MongoDB for the database in the backend.
6. socket.io in the node.js

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
